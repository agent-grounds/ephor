- `github-issues` provider: the user's GitHub issues by role — the ones they
  opened, and the ones they take part in without having opened. With no `repos`
  it searches the whole forge rather than a configured list, so an issue filed
  against a stranger's project is followed like any other; `updated_within_days`
  bounds the search instead of a repository list, and the comment fetch is
  skipped for issues that have none.
